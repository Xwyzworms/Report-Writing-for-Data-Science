# Evidence Based Data Analysis

Replication vs Reproducibility
- Replication
  - focuses on validity of scientific claim
  - if a study states “if X is related to Y” then we ask “is the claim true?”
  - need to reproduce results with new investigators, data, analytica methods, laboratories, instruments, etc.
  - particularly important in studies that can impact broad policy or regulatory decisions
  - stands as ultimate standard for strengthening scientific evidence
- Reproducibility
  - focuses on validity of data analysis
  - “Can we trust this analysis?”
  - reproduce results new investigators, same data, same methods
  - important when replication is impossible
  - arguably a minimum standard for any scientific study

Problems with Reproducibility
  - aiming for reproducibility provides for :
  - transparency of data analysis

    * check validity of analysis ! people check each other ! “self-correcting” community
    * re-run the analysis
    * check the code for bugs/errors/sensitivity
    * try alternate approaches

  - data/software/methods availability
  - improved transfer of knowledge

    * focuses on “downstream” aspect of research dissemination (does solve problems with erroneous analysis)
  - reproducibility does not guarantee
    - correctness of analysis (Could be wrong or true)
    - trustworthiness of analysis
    - deterrence of bad analysis
