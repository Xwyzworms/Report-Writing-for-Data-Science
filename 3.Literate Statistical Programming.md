## Literate Statistical Programming
 That is ,writing reproducible reports easier to understand.

- Think report or publication as a stream of text and code
- Text and code is readable by people (a.k.a Variable named,Description)
- code can be Executed.
- If there's a figures/tables there should be a text explained it.

## Weaving and Tangling (Pernah make notebook ? nah gitu.)
- can be Weaved (dirangkai) --> produce Human Readable
- can be tangled --> produce machine -readable "Machine readable code"

## Example To do Literate Statistical Programming in R
 - Sweave , not updated frequently
 - Knitr ,lot of improvement , recommended. written in R but Can be mixed to with latex markdown,html.

## Summary
- Literate statistical programming tools can make it easier to write up reproducible documents containing data analyses.

- Sweave was one of the first literate statistical programming
tools, which weaved together a statistical language (R) with a markup language (LaTeX).

- knitr is a package that builds on the work of Sweave and provides much more powerful functionality, including the ability to write in Markdown and create variety of output formats.
