#Only Notes :
-  Reproducible --> Make your work/result documented so that other people can use it for further a do.

- Replication --> As the Name Suggest , **REPLICATE** so other people do the same work as you did ,same result.

## What's Wrong with replication ?
- Nothing wrong for a long time ago, but today **Studies** are getting Bigger and Bigger we don't want to replicate things that already done , it's time & money consuming we want to improve the **Studies** ,right ?Then reproducibility is your only savior. Reproducibility is key to maintaining the history of a project and making sure that every step along the way is clear.
Some Studies Cannot be Replicated :
 - No time,opportunity
 - No money
 - UNIque

## Reproducibility to the Rescue
- Whay wee need this Reproducibility ?
 - Maybe Someone want to do another/correction your **Studies** that related with what you've done. So you should consider to do following :
  - Make Data publicly Available'
  - Computer codes are well Documented
  -All the steps of the computational analysis, including any preprocessing of data, should be fully described so that people can study it and reproduce it.
  - Well Documented Final report
- So, when another person run your studies/analysis his/she get the same result .

- Reproducible Reporting --> *Validation of the data analysis*

## From “X” to “Computational X”
That is , now days nearly every field involving data require Computational ,with this we can:
 - Get High dimensional dataset
 - Faster computation
 - We can work with large databases and do operation with it
 - We can implement more sophiscated complex analysis.


## Summary From author
- Replication, whereby scientific questions are examined and verified independently by different scientists, is the gold standard for scientific validity.
- Replication can be difficult and often there are no resources to independently replicate a study.
- Reproducibility, whereby data and code are re-analyzed
by independent scientists to obtain the same results of the original investigator, is a reasonable minimum standard when replication is not possible.

## Summary From Mine
- Reproducibility is the important thing for doing research or project ,it's make our job/works Reproducible.
- Replication is the hard one , m not going with it .
- Computational Resources getting bigger means there are a lot of data coming and replication is not a great idea.
