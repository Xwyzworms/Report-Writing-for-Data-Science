# Structure of a Data Analysis : Part 1

General Data analysis Steps :
- Defining question
- Defining the ideal dataset
- Determining what data you can access
- Obtaining the data
- Cleaning the data

* Section For Part 2:
- E.D.A
- Modelling
- Interpretation
- Challenging Result
- Write up
- Create Reproducible Code

## The Question :
- Question is the most powerful dimension Reduction .
- Sharp Question is the key to saving your time.
- Ask Question first before **DIVE** into the details of data.
- make the question more concrete and translate it using terms that are specific to data analysis tools.

## The Ideal dataset
This is just Suggestion :
  - If Interested in descriptive problem --> Think of a whole population
  - If Want to explore your question --> take random sample with a bunch of variables/columns
  - if Inference problem --> very carefully about the **sampling mechanism** and the definition of the population of the sample your sampling.
  - If making prediction --> Split data into training and testing data set
  - If Want to make *Causal* statement(i.e "What happens if i modify this variable components") --> Need experimental data (randomize trial / randomize study)
  - If you want to make mechanistic types of statements --> need data about all the different components of the system that youâ€™re trying to describe.

## The Real dataset
Rules When you using a data:
- Track when/where you get the data

## Cleaning the Data :
- Source of data is very important thing
- Take a look to general data information
  - if the data is messy ,clean it up . Especially the **RAW** data .
  - If it's already preprocessed,try to do this :
    - Understand how it was done ,the preprocessing.
    - Understand the data Source (experimental, Observational) ,how the sampling was done
  - if data is large,you might need to subset it in an correct way.
- When Doing cleaning data --> *Record what you've done , write what you've done ,DOcumented it well,so its Reproducible.*
- If you already get the data , then **DETERMINE if the data are
good enough to solve your problems.** ,Dont push it to hard,if it's not relevant you should search another,ask another question,try again , if you kept pushed, it can be your nightmare.aka misleading Interpretation.
