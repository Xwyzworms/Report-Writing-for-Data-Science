# 7. Structure of a Data Analysis: Part 2

Jumping off from the previous chapter, we can define some further steps in a data analysis to be :
• Exploratory data analysis
• Statistical prediction/modeling
• Interpretation of results
• Challenging of results
• Synthesis and write up
• Creating reproducible code

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Understand the data, distribution, pattern inside it for every variable. Of course based on your question of interest.
- it's worth exploring a little bit further, if you see some particular characteristics that are interesting.

## Statistical Modelling
 - Depend on your question of interest and EDA result
 - Take appropriate variables that measure your question
 - Always Ask "Measures of Uncertainty"
 - Look at the error rate and try to minimize it ,

## Interpreting Results
- Use language that easy to Understand (jargon used)
- Stay on your analysis result, don't go beyond it.
- it's good to give an explanation for why certain models predict better than
others, if possible.
- Measure the uncertainty ,Always do this

* Measures of uncertainty ,well i guess it just put some threshold of an event.

## Challenging the findings
- Asking everything from question to findings/result
- Challenge this :
  - Is this valid with my question?
  - Data Source? from where?
  - How the Processing goes on?
  - How The analysis done ?
  - What conclusion i got? is suitable with my question ? and how i got that.
  - Is this uncertainty reliable ?
  - is this the best model? why that would be?
  - are the any potential alternative analysis

## Synthesizing Results
- Write most important aspects that lead with the question that you were
trying to address.
-  Talk about the analyses of your data set in the order that’s appropriate
for the story you’re trying to tell
- Add figures

## Reproducible Code
- Finally, the thing that you want to make sure of is that you document your analysis as you go.
- KEEP EVERYTHING ORGANIZED WELL.
