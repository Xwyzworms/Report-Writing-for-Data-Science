## The Data Science Pipeline

GAMBAR

## Elements of Reproducibility

Things to make Results Reproducible :
- Analytic Data --> Data you used through your analysis.
- Analytic code --> This is just the code for what you've done through your analysis
- Documentation --> Data and code ,Documented it,
- Distribution --> How these things get accessed by other people

## Authors and readers:

- Authors --> produce research and make their research reproducible
- Readers --> Want to reproduce that work.

Problems With Readers who want reproduce the research:
- Different Computational Power
- Manually Download Resources
- Manually Execute the Code / Work .i.e Piece by piece

## Summary From author
- The process of conducting and disseminating research
can be depicted as a “data science pipeline”
- Readers and consumers of data science research are
typically not privy to the details of the data science
pipeline
- One view of reproducibility is that it gives research
consumers partial access to the raw pipeline elements
