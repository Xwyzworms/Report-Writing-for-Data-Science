# Reproducibility Checklist
From Author

- Start With good science
  - Ask the focusing/meaningful Question ,not vague.
- Don't Do Things By Hand
  - You should do everything with code , such as download file , Editing , reformating data files and ect.
  - If you do that by hand, it's hard to documented it.
- Don't Point and Click
  - Try not to use Interactive Interface when conducting data analysis.
- Teach A Computer
  - Do your work with code , precise and correct,such as downloading data.
- Use version Control
  - Git/github to keep track what you doing.
- Keep Track your Software Environment
  - If you Work With complex project you should point to these guys :
    - Computer architecture
    - OS
    - Software
    - Package
    - External dependencies --> Git/github / remote databases
    - Version Number of software / hardware / whatever it's
- Don't Save Output
  - Its OBVIO
- Set your Seed
  - seed(12) same result everytime
- Think About Entire Pipeline
  - Ask your self are these codes reproducible ? from getting data to the end

## Summary
• Are we doing good science? {Asking Great Question}
• Was any part of this analysis done by hand?If so, are
those parts precisely document? Does the documentation
match reality?
• Have we taught a computer to do as much as possible
(i.e. coded)?
• Are we using a version control system?
• Have we documented our software environment?
• Have we saved any output that we cannot reconstruct
from original data + code?
• How far back in the analysis pipeline can we go before
our results are no longer (automatically) reproducible?
